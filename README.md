# iix.se - A hugo homepage

This is an attempt to create a static homepage with basically just a blog. Gonna try this for a while now since I've already been interested in having a static homepage instead of having a real backend. Having git as a backend is also pretty cool for backup purposes.

The point is that instead of going to https://iix.se, logging in and type new posts there, I will instead go to https://github.com/lollek/iix.se-hugo, create a new post in the content/posts subdirectory and commit it. The website at https://iix.se will then be rebuilt automatically. To see how I did this see this post [On github](content/posts/134.md) / [On iix.se](https://iix.se/posts/134/)
