summary: A list of quality apparel I like
---

I keep buying clothes and shoes that only lasts a year or two due to wear, and/or fade.
So I've decided to try to write down brands and series that work, so I can stick to them.

## Jacket

My criterias:

* Look great
* Great fit
* Should be able to handle the elements for many years
* Must have a great hood
* Many pockets
  - 1-2 outside breast pockets
  - 2 outside hand pockets (+2 extra hand outside pockets for winter jackets)
  - 1-2 inside breast pocket
  - 1-2 inside low pockets

### Fjällräven - Skogsö Jacket M (Spring/Autumn Jacket)

Stylish everyday jacket. Protects against some rain and some wind, and is pretty breathable.
Exceptionally good hood. Has all the pockets you would need. Made out of G-1000,
so you can, and should, wax it.

### Everest - Down Parka (Winter Parka)

Probably as stylish as winter clothes get. Very warm and the hood can handle good weather as well as snowstorms.
Made for sub-zero temperatures, and I'd try to avoid rain.

## Trousers

My criterias:

* Look great with shirts and sweatshirts
* Great fit
* The color should not fade
* Not tear in the crotch

### These Glory Days - Bellevue Cotton Shorts (Summer Shorts)

Nice shorts for summer days. They sit quite high at the waist and have a french bearer.
I have these in size 48.

### WE Fashion - Chinos (Winter Chinos)

Very thick chinos. Great for winter but get sweaty during summer. I have these
in size 31x32, but I think 30x32 would fit better.

## Shoes

My criterias:

* Very cushioned (my feet are worn out)
* Durable enough to handle daily 1 hour walks
* Need not look great, but should at least look OK (looks are more important for summer than winter)

### Icebug - ELI RB9X (Summer Low Sneaker)

Great breathable sneakers. Exceptional in summer, but fine in spring and autumn when it doesn't rain.
I have these in size USA 8.5, UK 7.5, EU 41.5, CM 26.5.

### Icebug - HAZE M RB9X GTX (Spring/Autumn Low Sneakers)

Great all-round shoe that can handle any weather or terrain.
Probably good in the winter as well, but they are too low for snow.
I have these in size USA 9, UK 8, EU 42, CM 27

### Hanwag - Tatra II Wide GTX (Winter boots)

Very stable, sturdy and warm. Can handle any weather, but you feel about as
nimble in these as you do in your ski boots.


## Hall of Shame

**Trousers' color faded quickly**

* Samsøe & Samsøe
* Four.ten
* East West - Bowery Chinos

**Trousers tore in the crotch**

* Levi's
