Since I've been introduced to the fact that programmable, ortholinear keyboards exist, I can stop thinking about buying one.
Since they are super expensive, I'll try to write down alternatives here.

## OLKB Prenoic @ Drop (50% Keyboard)
* [Base Kit (PCB + Case + Plates)](https://drop.com/buy/preonic-mechanical-keyboard) = $140
* OLKB Keycaps = $30
* Pack of switches = $40
* Estimated total - excl VAT, tarrifs, etc = $210
* Estimated total - incl 25% charges + $30 shipping = $295

## Planck EZ (40% Keyboard)
* [Full kit](https://www.zsa.io/planck/buy/) = $245
* Estimated total - incl 25% charges + $0 shipping = $305
