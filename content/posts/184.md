An old story that I like.

## The Scorpion and the Frog 
> A scorpion wants to cross a river but cannot swim, so it asks a frog to carry it across. 
> 
> The frog hesitates, afraid that the scorpion might sting it, but the scorpion promises not to, 
> pointing out that it would drown if it killed the frog in the middle of the river. 
> 
> The frog considers this argument sensible and agrees to transport the scorpion. 
> 
> Midway across the river, the scorpion stings the frog anyway, dooming them both. 
> The dying frog asks the scorpion why it stung despite knowing the consequence, to which the scorpion replies: 
> "It's in my nature"

## The Scorpion and the Elephant
> A scorpion wants to cross a river but cannot swim, so it asks an elephant to carry it across. 
> 
> The elephant hesitates, afraid that the scorpion might sting it, but the scorpion promises not to.
> 
> The elephant agrees to transport the scorpion. 
> 
> Midway across the river, the scorpion raises its tail, as if to sting the elephant. 
> The elephant quickly tosses the scorpion in the water, which will eventually drown the scorpion.
> 
> "Why did you do that? I never stung you!" cried the scorpion.
> The elephant replies, “Oh, I know. But I have heard the story of you and the frog.”
