## Working with certificates in Java
This post contains a mix of java and certificate info. Note that you should definitely use the p12 format in Java.
Using other types, like p8, usually end up causing issues in the end.
One easy way is by creating a custom trust manager

The easiest way of doing this is: ([See this link for a code example on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/24561444)
1. Create a custom trust manager with your special certs
2. Create a trust manager with the default certs
3. Create a custom trust manager, which takes the custom and the default trust manager and try them both

Another way of doing it would be adding the certificate manually to the cacerts file. 
Note that you will either need the full certificate chain for it to work, or just the root cert might also work.
Note that certs added to the java key store must be in DER-format. See below for converting between formats.
When adding with the keytool, you will either need to specify the path manually, or add it with the `-cacerts` flag to add it to the main key store.
The keystore will ask you for password, but the password usually is changeit

### Adding to keystore
```bash
# Replace FILEPATH with the cert-file and ALIAS with any given alias, which can be anything, but must be unique.
sudo keytool -keystore /etc/ssl/certs/java/cacerts -import -file FILEPATH -alias ALIAS
```

```bash
# Example of adding through a noninteractive script. Note that -cacerts is used instead of -keystore ...
keytool -noprompt -trustcacerts -storepass changeit -import -alias myserver -cacerts -file /tmp/server.der
```

### Show contents of keystore
```bash
keytool -v -list -keystore path-to-keystore
```

## OpenSSL generation commands

## Generate self-signed root ca cert
```bash
openssl req -x509 -sha256 -days 1825 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout rootca.key -out rootca.crt
```

## OpenSSL conversion commands

### Unpack whole p12 into pem file
```bash
openssl pkcs12 -in infile.p12 -out outfile.pem -nodes
```

### Unpack key from p12
```bash
openssl pkcs12 -in infile.p12 -out outfile.key -nodes -nocerts
```

### Pack a p12 from pem and key
```bash
openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey certfile.key -in certfile.pem -out certfile.p12
```

### Convert PEM/CRT to or from DER
Change `-inform`, `-outform`, `-in` and `-out- as appropriate
```bash
openssl x509 -outform der -in server.crt -out server.der
```

## OpenSSL validation commands

### Validate you have a key required by server
Validate that you can access an port protected by a key. You should get some verbose data but the connection should stay open.
```bash
openssl s_client -connect hostname:443 -cert outfile.pem -key outfile.key
```

### Validate that you trust a server
This will verify your general settings. There will be a lot of text. Verify return code should be 0.
```bash
openssl s_client -connect ldaps-server:636 </dev/null
```

You can also add the `–CAfile` or `–CApath` flags for troubleshooting.
To use `–CApath` you might need to run `openssl rehash path/to/capath` after adding the certs if you have a chain. 

### Verify a certificate locally without connecting
```bash
openssl verify -show_chain server.crt
```

### Check end date of pem file
```bash
openssl x509 -enddate -noout -in outfile.pem
```

### Download a certificate from a server
Add `–verify 5` to get intermediary certs
```bash
openssl s_client -connect the.ldap.server.net:636 -showcerts < /dev/null > server.crt
```

Ignore due to america. You need to manually enable good ciphers if you have a low version of Java8. Otherwise you can also upgrade to 8u161 and it will automatically work.
