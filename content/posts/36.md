## Description:
* Configure your DNS server to include SPF records for your domain.
* The only acceptable as a source of e-mail from your domain is your server.
* The SPF record should reflect this.

## Implementation:
1. Add line to /etc/bind/db.d4.sysinst.ida.liu.se:
    ```@        IN     TXT     "v=spf1 mx -all"```
2. Restart service:
    ```service bind9 reload```

## Verification:
* `dig d4.sysinst.ida.liu.se TXT` should return the above line
* Sending an email from server.d4.sysinst.ida.liu.se to e.g. a gmail should
    have a 'Received-SPF: pass' in the header.
* Sending an email from another client should have a 'Received-SPF: fail' in the
    header
