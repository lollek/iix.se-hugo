| Diamine   | Red Dragon    | Great      | Medium             | Great ink with a great color                        |
| Diamine   | Majestic Blue | Good       | Wet, slow dry time | Great saturation, just not my favorite kind of blue |
| Diamine   | Evergreen     | Good       | Medium             | An alright, run of the mill green                   |
| Lamy      | Blue          | Fine       | Dry                | Feels a bit unsaturated from time to time           |
| Lamy      | Blue-Black    | Fine       | Dry                | A boring color                                      |
