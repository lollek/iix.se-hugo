Guide to Moria Adventuring (or How to Slay Your Balrog)

The information on this page comes from Beej's moria page, 30 minutes of UMoria,
investigating the source code, and simply playing the game.
If there's something you want to know that I don't mention, it's likely
mentioned in one of the links.
