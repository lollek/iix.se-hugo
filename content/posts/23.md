Things about git which I sometimes forget

## Recovering from a spaghetti branch

Different ways of handling when you've branched from a branch, which later gets merged to a branch which you also want to merge to.

### rebase --onto
You have created CURRENTBRANCH from OLDBRANCH which later got merged into NEWBRANCH. 
Now you want to clean up OLDBRANCH branch to reflect the real changes based on NEWBRANCH before a pull request.
```bash
git rebase --onto NEWBRANCH OLDBRANCH CURRENTBRANCH
```

### reset --soft
You have created CURRENTBRANCH from OLDBRANCH which later got merged into NEWBRANCH. 
Since then you have merged some branches and your git history looks like a mess. 
You've tried everything and now you just want your changes in a commit and be done with it.
```bash
# Find the commit prior to your first commit where CURRENTBRANCH branches from OLDBRANCH call it PREVCOMMIT
git reset --soft PREVCOMMIT
git commit
git rebase --onto NEWBRANCH OLDBRANCH CURRENTBRANCH
```

## Rename branch
```bash
git branch -m OLDNAME NEWNAME
```

## Remove everything in DIR which is not version controlled.
```bash
git clean -fxd DIR
```

## Force push several branches
```bash
# Force push (+) branch 1 to branch1 and branch2 on origin
git push origin +branch1 +branch1:branch2
```

## Chmod files on windows
```bash
git update-index --chmod=+x <file>
```

## Find git-special folders
```bash
# Git hook path
git rev-parse --git-path hooks

# Active git dir
git rev-parse --git-dir
```
