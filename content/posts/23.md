Things about git which I sometimes forget

```bash
git branch -m old new  # Rename branch

git clean -fxd DIR     # Remove everything in DIR which is not version controlled.

git push origin +branch1 +branch1:branch2   # Force push (+) branch 1 to branch1 and branch2 on origin

## You have created CURRENTBRANCH from OLDBRANCH which later got merged into NEWBRANCH. Now you want to clean up OLDBRANCH branch to reflect the real changes based on NEWBRANCH
git rebase --onto NEWBRANCH OLDBRANCH CURRENTBRANCH
```

# Chmod files on windows
git update-index --chmod=+x <file>
