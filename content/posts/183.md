summary: How to install a snipping tool with shortcut on Linux
---

Windows 10 impressed me with how it integrated the snipping tool to make it easy to use.
Basically, they removed the application itself and made it reachable on pressing Shift + Super + S.
After executing the shortcut, you were able to select the area you liked and it would create an image for you.
This guide describes how to get the same, or actually slightly better, behavior in Linux (Gnome).

1. Install Flameshot on your local machine by running `sudo apt install flameshot`
2. Go to Settings > Keyboard Shortcuts and click the large + on the bottom.
3. Set the name to `Flameshot`, the command to `flameshot gui` and set the shortcut to Shift + Super + S. 
 
Sometimes, it won't accept the shortcut, this means that there is a blocking shortcut which you need to remove first.

So now, you can press Shift + Super + S and you will be able to mark an area. 
After marking the area, there are several options to add markers and text to the image. 
It's pretty self-explanatory so I think you will figure it out.
