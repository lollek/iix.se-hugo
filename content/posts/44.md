The first *RewriteCond* allows requests for files which already exists,
The second *RewriteCond* allowed requests for directories which already exists,
The third *RewriteCond* makes sure to not redirect any of the *data*, *html*, *css* or *js* directories

The first *RewriteRule* says that if any of the *RewriteCond* matched, we do not do anything else
(i.e. return from this function)
The second *RewriteRule* says that if we have not returned from the previous *RewriteRule* we will return index.html
instead of what was requested (which makes html5mode work)

    # For angular html5mode

    RewriteEngine On

    # If an existing asset or directory is requested go to it as it is
    RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}%{REQUEST_URI} -f [OR]
    RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}%{REQUEST_URI} -d [OR]
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/(data|html|css|js)/
    RewriteRule ^ - [L]

    # If the requested resource doesn't exist, use index.html
    RewriteRule ^ /index.html
