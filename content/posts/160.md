Some notes on a watch I have been given, which I'm trying to identify.

Text on dial: Javil - 21 Jewels - Incabloc - Antimagnetic - Waterprotected - Swiss made

Text on case back: Stainless steel back - Waterproof Antimagnetic - Incabloc swiss made - 4852 - 71

## Data

Measurements are done by me, and might not be the official numbers.

* Width: 33mm
* Length: 42mm
* Lug-to-lug: 18mm
* Movement: Likely [AS 1188](http://www.ranfft.de/cgi-bin/bidfun-db.cgi?10&ranfft&0&2uswk&AS_1188).
  - See image below and compare. It's very similar to AS 1188
  - Note that it has 21 jewels, but in the image below you can see that it has jewels jammed into useless locations.
* Case seems to be made of nickle plated brass
* Crystal: Acrylic

## Notes

* A local watchmaker said they would need to open it up to give a service cost estimate (which would cost 300 SEK), but to expect the service cost to be 3500 SEK or more.
