## Functions in Helm
* [Go Template](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template)
* [Sprig](https://masterminds.github.io/sprig/)

## Debugging Templates
Debugging templates can be tricky because the rendered templates are sent to the Kubernetes API server, which may reject the YAML files for reasons other than formatting.

There are a few commands that can help you debug.

* `helm lint` is your go-to tool for verifying that your chart follows best practices
* `helm install --dry-run --debug` or `helm template --debug`: We've seen this trick already. It's a great way to have the server render your templates, then return the resulting manifest file.
* `helm get manifest`: This is a good way to see what templates are installed on the server.
