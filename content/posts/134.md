Hugo is a framework for building static webpages. It pairs well with creating a git repository and creating a push-webhook which rebuilds the homepage every time you change it.
This post is just documenting how to do just that for an existing hugo repository.

## Create a static repo with nginx pointing to it
1. Clone a hugo repo and put it in /srv/hugo.iix.se
2. Pop over to the folder and run `hugo` to generate a static page
3. `chown -R nginx:nginx /srv/hugo.iix.se`
4. Create a nginx vhost with `location / { root /srv/hugo.iix.se/public }`
5. `systemctl nginx reload`
6. Check that the page works

## Create an endpoint for updating 
This can be be done in a number of ways, but an easy way is creating a fastcgi endpoint in nginx, since we got that running already.

1. Install fastcgi-wrap on your server
2. Create a new folder for scripts, say `/srv/remote-scripts`
3. Create a script for updating hugo. Call it e.g. `rebuild-hugo.sh` Example:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
LOGFILE=/srv/hugo.iix.se/hugo.log

echo "====================" >> $LOGFILE 2>&1
date >> $LOGFILE 2>&1
echo "Received git webhook" >> $LOGFILE 2>&1

echo "HTTP/1.0 200 OK"
echo "Content-type: text/plain"
echo ""

cd /srv/hugo.iix.se/
git fetch >> $LOGFILE 2>&1
git reset --hard origin/master >> $LOGFILE 2>&1
rm -rf public >> $LOGFILE 2>&1
/usr/bin/hugo >> $LOGFILE 2>&1


```
4. Create a new nginx vhost for remote scripts. You will need the following location stuff
```nginx
location / {
    gzip off;
    root /srv/remote-scripts;
    fastcgi_pass unix:/run/fcgiwrap/fcgiwrap-nginx.sock;
}
```
5. `systemct reload nginx`
6. Make sure you can curl remote-scripts.iix.se/rebuild-hugo.sh and that it rebuilds your website

## Create webhook
1. Go to https://github.com/$username/$repository/settings/hooks/new
2. Set up a payload URL, should be remote-scripts.iix.se/rebuild-hugo.sh from above.
3. Add a secret
4. Click **Add Webhook**
5. Try updating your git repostory and make sure it updates your server in a few seconds
