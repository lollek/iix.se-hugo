### PUMA MagMax NITRO (2025)

- [Stats over att runrepeat.com](https://runrepeat.com/puma-magmax-nitro).

Lots of shoe. Very cushioned and comfortable, but not especially nimble. Great
for running a longer distance at a slower pace. Noticeable high drop, making me
heel-strike from time to time, which I don't otherwise do.


### Adidas Adizero Boston 12 (2025)

- [Stats over att runrepeat.com](https://runrepeat.com/adidas-adizero-boston-12).

Stiff and stable shoe, but delivers effortless speed.
The only negative would be its lack of comfort.

### PUMA Deviate Nitro 2 (2025)

- [Stats over att runrepeat.com](https://runrepeat.com/puma-deviate-nitro-2).

These shoes seem great, but the low drop combined with the carbon fiber plate causes massive achilles tendon issues for me.
So I have a hard time testing them.

### ASICS Novablast 5 (2024)

- [Stats over att runrepeat.com](https://runrepeat.com/asics-novablast-5).

Very tall stack. They are outrageously soft and bouncy when new, maybe even uncomfortably bouncy in the heel.
Gets pretty firm in negative degrees though. 
Then after the next few hundred kilometers, they lose some of their bounce and become more soft and cushy instead.
All in all, it's a great shoe for most runs. 

### Saucony Endorphin Speed 1 (2024)

Light, springy shoes. Somewhere in between Saucony Triumph 21 and Saucony Endorphin Speed 4. Great for most runs, but not the best for any.

### Saucony Endorphin Speed 4 (2024)

- [Stats over att runrepeat.com](https://runrepeat.com/saucony-endorphin-speed-4).

Too small for me. Should have gone for half a size up.
I could only run short distances in these because of the wrong size, and had to sell them.
Such a shame since they seem great for running faster paces (but hard to run slow in).
They also seem a bit slappy when running.

### Saucony Triumph 21 (2024)

- [Stats over att runrepeat.com](https://runrepeat.com/saucony-triumph-21).

I should have gone for half a size down, but they still fit alright when heel-locked.
Extremely good shoes. Soft and bouncy. Maybe a bit heavy when running for a long time, but I haven't really tested them for long runs.

### ASICS Gel Cumulus 25 (2023)

- [Stats over att runrepeat.com](https://runrepeat.com/asics-gel-cumulus-25).

These shoes are the worst shoes I've ever run in.
They feel sluggish running in them, turning all my runs into easy recovery runs.

## Other shoes

### New Balance FuelCell Rebel v4

I tried a size 42, which was way too short. I probably have 42.5 or 43 in New Balance shoes.
