## Owned shoes

### ASICS Novablast 5 (2024)

- Weight: 255g
- Drop: 8.0mm (brand)
- Size: USA 8.5, UK 7.5, EU 42, CM 26.5
- Pace: Easy, Tempo, Threshold
- Score: 5/5

Perfect fit. Very bouncy shoes (similar to NB Rebel v4) with a tall stack. Gets pretty firm in negative degrees though.
They also seem a bit slappy when running.

### Saucony Endorphin Speed 1 (2024)

- Size: USA 9, UK 8, EU 42.5
- Pace: Tempo, Threshold, Interval
- Score: 4/5

Perfect fit. They feel lighter but less springy than the Speed 4.

### Saucony Endorphin Speed 4 (2024)

- [Stats over att runrepeat.com](https://runrepeat.com/saucony-endorphin-speed-4).
- Weight: 237g
- Drop: 8.0mm (brand) / 8.7mm (lab)
- Size: USA 8.5, UK 7.5, EU 42, CM 26.5
- Pace: Tempo, Threshold, Interval
- Score: 5/5

Too small for me. Should have gone for the 42.5. I can only run short distances in these.
Such a shame since they seem great for running faster paces (but hard to run slow in).

### Saucony Triumph 21 (2024)

- [Stats over att runrepeat.com](https://runrepeat.com/saucony-triumph-21).
- Weight: 282g
- Drop: 10.0mm (brand) / 10.5mm (lab)
- Size: USA 9.5, UK 8.5, EU 43, CM 27.5
- Pace: Easy, Tempo, Threshold
- Score: 5/5

The shoes fit a bit long, so I should maybe have gone for 42 or 42.5 instead. There
is no problem with the fit though, just feels a bit long. Maybe the rocker is a bit off because of the
length. Otherwise, they are extremely good shoes. Soft and bouncy. Maybe a bit
heavy when running for a long time.

### ASICS Gel Cumulus 25 (2023)

- [Stats over att runrepeat.com](https://runrepeat.com/asics-gel-cumulus-25).
- Weight: 269g
- Drop: 8.0mm (brand) / 11.2mm (lab)
- Size: USA 9, UK 8, EU 42.5, CM 27
- Pace: Easy
- Score: 1/5

Good fit. However, the shoes are the worst shoes I've ever run in.
They feel flat when landing and there is lots of excessive padding on the side
of the shoe, which makes it even more clunky.

## Other shoes

### New Balance FuelCell Rebel v4

I tried a size 42, which was way too short. I probably have 42.5 or 43 in New Balance shoes. 

## Adidas Adizero Boston 12

I tried a size 42 2/3, which was way too long. I probably have 42 or possibly even 41 1/3 in this shoe.
