## Owned shoes

### Saucony Endorphin Speed 4 (2024)

- [Stats over att runrepeat.com](https://runrepeat.com/saucony-endorphin-speed-4).
- Weight: 237g
- Drop: 8.0mm (brand) / 8.7mm (lab)
- Size: 42.5
- Pace: Tempo, Threshold, Interval
- Score: 5/5

Probably as perfect of a fit I can possibly get. Great for running faster paces,
but hard to run slow in.

### Saucony Triumph 21 (2024)

- [Stats over att runrepeat.com](https://runrepeat.com/saucony-triumph-21).
- Weight: 282g
- Drop: 10.0mm (brand) / 10.5mm (lab)
- Size: 43
- Pace: Easy, Tempo, Threshold
- Score: 5/5

The shoes fit a bit long, so I should probably have gone for 42.5 instead. There
is no problem with the fit though. Maybe the rocker is a bit off because of the
length. Otherwise, they are extremely good shoes. Soft and bouncy. Maybe a bit
heavy when running for a long time.

### ASICS Gel Cumulus 25 (2023)

- [Stats over att runrepeat.com](https://runrepeat.com/asics-gel-cumulus-25).
- Weight: 269g
- Drop: 8.0mm (brand) / 11.2mm (lab)
- Size: 42.5
- Pace: Easy
- Score: 1/5

They fit a bit roomy, so I maybe should have gone with 42. There is no problem
with the fit though. Otherwise, the shoes are the worst shoes I've ever run in.
They feel flat when landing and there is lots of excessive padding on the side
of the shoe, which makes it even more clunky.

## Other shoes

### New Balance FuelCell Rebel v4

I tried a size 42. Most of the shoe was slightly roomy but fine, the length
wise, it was probably a full size too small. The dimensions absolutely do not work
for me.
