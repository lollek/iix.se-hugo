## Owned shoes

### ASICS Novablast 5 (2024)

- [Stats over att runrepeat.com](https://runrepeat.com/asics-novablast-5).
- Weight: 255g
- Stack height: 41.5mm
- Drop: 8.0mm
- Size: USA 8.5, UK 7.5, EU 42, CM 26.5
- Pace: Easy, Tempo
- Score: 5/5

Perfect fit. 
Very tall, very bouncy shoes (similar to NB Rebel v4) with a tall stack. 
Gets pretty firm in negative degrees though.
They also seem a bit slappy when running.

### Saucony Endorphin Speed 1 (2024)

- Weight: 221g
- Stack height: 35.5mm
- Drop: 8.0mm
- Size: USA 9, UK 8, EU 42.5
- Pace: Tempo, Threshold, Interval
- Score: 4/5

Perfect fit. They feel lighter but less springy than the Speed 4.

### Saucony Endorphin Speed 4 (2024)

- [Stats over att runrepeat.com](https://runrepeat.com/saucony-endorphin-speed-4).
- Weight: 237g
- Stack height: 38mm
- Drop: 8.0mm
- Size: USA 8.5, UK 7.5, EU 42, CM 26.5
- Pace: Tempo, Threshold, Interval
- Score: 5/5

Too small for me. Should have gone for the 42.5. I can only run short distances in these.
Such a shame since they seem great for running faster paces (but hard to run slow in).
They also seem a bit slappy when running.

### Saucony Triumph 21 (2024)

- [Stats over att runrepeat.com](https://runrepeat.com/saucony-triumph-21).
- Weight: 282g
- Stack height: 39mm
- Drop: 10.0mm
- Size: USA 9.5, UK 8.5, EU 43, CM 27.5
- Pace: Recovery, Easy, Tempo, Threshold
- Score: 5/5

The shoes fit a bit long, so I should maybe have gone for 42 or 42.5 instead. There
is no problem with the fit though, just feels a bit long. Maybe the rocker is a bit off because of the
length. Otherwise, they are extremely good shoes. Soft and bouncy. Maybe a bit
heavy when running for a long time.

### ASICS Gel Cumulus 25 (2023)

- [Stats over att runrepeat.com](https://runrepeat.com/asics-gel-cumulus-25).
- Weight: 269g
- Stack height: 37.5mm
- Drop: 8.0mm
- Size: USA 9, UK 8, EU 42.5, CM 27
- Pace: Recovery
- Score: 1/5

Good fit. However, the shoes are the worst shoes I've ever run in.
It feels sluggish running in them, turning all my runs into recovery runs.

## Other shoes

### New Balance FuelCell Rebel v4

I tried a size 42, which was way too short. I probably have 42.5 or 43 in New Balance shoes. 

### Adidas Adizero Boston 12

I tried a size 42 2/3, which was way too long. I probably have 42 in this shoe.
