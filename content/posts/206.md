## Owned shoes

### Saucony Endorphin Speed 4 (2024)

- [Stats over att runrepeat.com](https://runrepeat.com/saucony-endorphin-speed-4).
- Weight: 237g
- Drop: 8.0mm (brand) / 8.7mm (lab)
- Size: USA 8.5, UK 7.5, EU 42, CM 26.5
- Pace: Tempo, Threshold, Interval
- Score: 5/5

A tiny bit too small for me. Should have gone for the 42.5. But it's close to perfect.
Great for running faster paces but hard to run slow in.

### Saucony Triumph 21 (2024)

- [Stats over att runrepeat.com](https://runrepeat.com/saucony-triumph-21).
- Weight: 282g
- Drop: 10.0mm (brand) / 10.5mm (lab)
- Size: USA 9.5, UK 8.5, EU 43, CM 27.5
- Pace: Easy, Tempo, Threshold
- Score: 5/5

The shoes fit a bit long, so I should maybe have gone for 42 or 42.5 instead. There
is no problem with the fit though, just feels a bit long. Maybe the rocker is a bit off because of the
length. Otherwise, they are extremely good shoes. Soft and bouncy. Maybe a bit
heavy when running for a long time.

### ASICS Gel Cumulus 25 (2023)

- [Stats over att runrepeat.com](https://runrepeat.com/asics-gel-cumulus-25).
- Weight: 269g
- Drop: 8.0mm (brand) / 11.2mm (lab)
- Size: USA 9, UK 8, EU 42.5, CM 27
- Pace: Easy
- Score: 1/5

Great fit, but might have been able to go with the 42s.
However, the shoes are the worst shoes I've ever run in.
They feel flat when landing and there is lots of excessive padding on the side
of the shoe, which makes it even more clunky.

## Other shoes

### New Balance FuelCell Rebel v4

I tried a size 42, which was way too short. I probably have 42.5 or 43 in New Balance shoes. 

## Adidas Adizero Boston 12

I tried a size 42 2/3, which was way too long. I probably have 42 or possibly even 41 1/3 in this shoe.
