## Owned shoes

### Adidas Adizero Boston 12 (2025)

- [Stats over att runrepeat.com](https://runrepeat.com/adidas-adizero-boston-12).
- Weight: 260g
- Stack height: 37mm (34.5mm)
- Drop: 6.5mm (6.1mm)
- Size: USA 8.5, UK 8, EU 42, J 265, CHN 260
- Pace: Steady, Tempo, Long
- Score: 4/5
- Fit: Big for its size, but still fits pretty well in my normal size. I heel lock these for good measure.

Stiff and stable shoe, but delivers effortless speed.
The only negative would be its lack of comfort.

### PUMA Deviate Nitro 2 (2025)

- [Stats over att runrepeat.com](https://runrepeat.com/puma-deviate-nitro-2).
- Weight: 260g
- Stack height: 38mm (31.7mm)
- Drop: 8.0mm (5.6mm)
- Size: USA 9, UK 8, EU 42, CM 27
- Pace: Steady, Tempo, Long
- Score: -
- Fit: Perfect in my normal size

These shoes seem great, but the low drop combined with the carbon fiber plate causes massive achilles tendon issues for me.
So I have a hard time testing them.

### ASICS Novablast 5 (2024)

- [Stats over att runrepeat.com](https://runrepeat.com/asics-novablast-5).
- Weight: 255g
- Stack height: 41.5mm (40.9mm)
- Drop: 8.0mm (7.4mm)
- Size: USA 8.5, UK 7.5, EU 42, CM 26.5
- Pace: Easy, Steady, Tempo?
- Score: 3/5
- Fit: Perfect, if possibly a bit snug in the toes. These are half a size down from what I usually have in ASICS.

Very tall stack. They are outrageously soft and bouncy when new, maybe even uncomfortably bouncy in the heel. Gets pretty firm in negative degrees though. 
Then after the next few hundred kilometers, they lose most of their bounce and become soft and cushy instead.
I liked them the most somewhere in between, but neither of the extremes. 
All in all, it's a good shoe in all its phases, but it's not great that it changes so much over time.

### Saucony Endorphin Speed 1 (2024)

- Weight: 221g
- Stack height: 35.5mm
- Drop: 8.0mm
- Size: USA 9, UK 8, EU 42.5
- Pace: Easy, Steady, Tempo
- Score: 4/5
- Fit: Perfect in my normal size.

Light, springy shoes. Somewhere in between Saucony Triumph 21 and Saucony Endorphin Speed 4. Great for most runs.

### Saucony Endorphin Speed 4 (2024)

- [Stats over att runrepeat.com](https://runrepeat.com/saucony-endorphin-speed-4).
- Weight: 237g
- Stack height: 38mm (36.2mm)
- Drop: 8.0mm (8.7mm)
- Size: USA 8.5, UK 7.5, EU 42, CM 26.5
- Pace: Steady, Tempo, Long
- Score: 5/5
- Fit: Too small for me. Should have gone for half a size up.

I could only run short distances in these because of the wrong size, and had to sell them.
Such a shame since they seem great for running faster paces (but hard to run slow in).
They also seem a bit slappy when running.

### Saucony Triumph 21 (2024)

- [Stats over att runrepeat.com](https://runrepeat.com/saucony-triumph-21).
- Weight: 282g
- Stack height: 39mm (39.1mm)
- Drop: 10.0mm (10.5mm)
- Size: USA 9.5, UK 8.5, EU 43, CM 27.5
- Pace: Recovery, Easy, Steady, Tempo
- Score: 5/5
- Fit: I should have gone for half a size down, but they still fit alright when heel-locked.

Extremely good shoes. Soft and bouncy. Maybe a bit heavy when running for a long time.

### ASICS Gel Cumulus 25 (2023)

- [Stats over att runrepeat.com](https://runrepeat.com/asics-gel-cumulus-25).
- Weight: 269g
- Stack height: 37.5mm (38.4mm)
- Drop: 8.0mm (11.2mm)
- Size: USA 9, UK 8, EU 42.5, CM 27
- Pace: Recovery, Easy
- Score: 1/5
- Fit: Great

These shoes are the worst shoes I've ever run in.
They feel sluggish running in them, turning all my runs into recovery runs.

## Other shoes

### New Balance FuelCell Rebel v4

I tried a size 42, which was way too short. I probably have 42.5 or 43 in New Balance shoes.
