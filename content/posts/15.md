If you get questionmarks instead of phone name when trying to run your app, you
can fix it with the following code:
```bash
#! /usr/bin/env bash
path="/opt/android-studio"  # Path where Android Studio is installed
set -e

"$path/sdk/platform-tools/adb" kill-server
sudo "$path/sdk/platform-tools/adb" start-server
"$path/sdk/platform-tools/adb" devices
```


If it doesn't work the first time, try a few more times
