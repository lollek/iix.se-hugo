Recently, I had to do some stuff on an ESXI-machine from a Linux machine. 
However the ESXI-version was so old that you needed the vSphere Client to modify it, and I never really got that working.
Luckily you can do quite much through ssh. So I thought I'd write down the commands I still remember.

```bash
## Write this to get all available commands
vim-cmd

## Virtual Machine commands
vim-cmd vmsvc

## Show VMs with some stats
vim-cmd vmsvc/getallvms

## Show power status of VM
vim-cmd vmsvc/power.getstate <vmid>

## Power on a VM
vim-cmd vmsvc/power.on <vmid>
```
