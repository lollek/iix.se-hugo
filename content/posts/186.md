Easy peasy recipe

## Ingredients
* A few Salmond fillets
* Some almond flakes
* Parmesan cheese
* 2 dl Creme fraiche
* A jar of lumpfish roe

## Steps
1. Take the almond flakes and mix with some ground parmesan cheese.
2. You can salt and pepper the salmon fillets for good measure, but I usually don't.
3. Put the mix over the salmon fillets, they top should be comfortably covered, but not thickly so.
4. Put salmon fillets in the oven. Maybe 175Â°C for 20 minutes, or when you are comfortable eating the salmon.
5. Mix the creme fraiche with the lumpfish roe. Throw in some chives if you have any on hand.
6. Serve with amandine potatoes
