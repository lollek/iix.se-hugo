# What I expected

After installing Heroes of Might and Magic VI and then starting it through Steam, the game should enter the main menu.

# What I got

The game screen is only black and never enters the main menu.

# How I solved it

* Go to *My Documents* > *Heroes of Might and Magic VI*.
* Open *ProfileData* with your favorite text editor
* Replace `<gfx_Fullscreen2>Fullscreen</gfx_Fullscreen2>` with `<gfx_Fullscreen2>Windowed</gfx_Fullscreen2>`
* Start game.

Game will be in windowed mode, but it's better than nothing
