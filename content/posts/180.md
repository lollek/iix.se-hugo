## System Locale

### Locale configuration (init / sysV)
```bash
## Show active locale
locale

## Show active charmap
locale charmap

## Show available (installed) locales
locale -a

## Change locale (for local use)
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8

## Change locale (for global use)
update-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8

## Change X11 keyboard layout (for local use)
setxkbmap -layout us -variant intl

## Change X11 keyboard layout (for global use)
sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration
```

## Locale configuration (systemd)
```bash
## Show active locale
localectl status

## Show active charmap
locale charmap

## Show available (installed) locales
localectl list-locales

## Change locale
localectl set-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8

## Change X11 keyboard layout
localectl set-x11-keymap us
```

## Preferrable configuration
* Use en_US as much as possible. It will avoid bugs and in general work best
* Best X11 layout is keymap=`us`, layout=`us`, variant=`altgr-intl`
