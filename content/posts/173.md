Some notes on troubleshooting different encodings for sent/received files. 

## Table

|Encoding| å    | ä    | ö    | Å    | Ä    | Ö    |
|--------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
|UTF-8   |\c3\a5|\c3\a4|\c3\b6|\c3\85|\c3\84|\c3\96|
|latin1  |\e5   |\e4   |\f6   |\c5   |\c4   |\d6   |
|CP437   |\86   |\84   |\94   |\8f   |\8e   |\99   |
|CP850   |\86   |\84   |\94   |\8f   |\8e   |\99   |

### Notes
- WINDOWS-1252 / CP-1252 is a superset of latin1
- All encodings are supersets of ASCII, so \20=SPACE and \0a=NEWLINE
- Sometimes you will encounter the "ANSI"-encoding. That name is a lie, and means that the creator is stupid in the head. 
There is no way of knowing what the creator indents, so you will have to try one encoding at a time and hope for the best.

## Vim commands

If you hover over a character and type `ga`, you will see the VIM interpretation of the encoding. 
Note that this will NOT necessarily be the FILE-encoding, but instead the VIM-encoding.

```bash
# BASH
vim -b FILENAME   # Open vim and see binary (doesn't always work)

# VIM
:e ++enc=1252 filename.txt # Reinterpret file as WINDOWS-1252
%!hexdump -C               # Read whole file as hex (if desperate)
```
