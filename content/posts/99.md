These are my installation notes for creating a lightweight linux desktop environment from scratch, which contains only the most necessary applications. I'll probably update it slightly in the future, when I realize I have missed some application. It will contain both openbox and dwm, as I'm always torn between using a tiling versus a floating window manager. Mostly I prefer tiling ones, but with some applications, they simply don't work well.

Scripts are [here](https://github.com/lollek/dotfiles/tree/master/lite-de)  

## Install the base distro
I prefer the [Debian mini ISO](https://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/). Make sure to not install anything which is not required.  

## Add sudo
```bash
su - root
apt install sudo
visudo

# Add the row and save
iix    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```

## Change terminal resolution
```grub
# /etc/default/grub

GRUB_GFXMODE=1024x768
GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=keep
```

```bash
sudo update-grub
sudo reboot
```

## Install base configuration
```bash
sudo apt install git
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/lollek/dotfiles.git
dotfiles/install dotfiles lite-de
```
Log out and login again

##  Configure openbox and friends
Start openbox with `startx-openbox`.  
Right click background and run ObConf. Set theme to FlatSlate.  
Configure tint2 with `tint2conf`.  
Don't forget to set correct background image in `$HOME/.config/openbox/autostart` later.  

## Configure dwm and friends
Start dwm with `startx-dwm`.  
All styling should already be applied through patches, and then running `make && sudo make install`. I have some in the *patches* subfolder.
