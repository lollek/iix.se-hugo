Recently I received a watch my dad used to wear - a Seiko Chronograph 7T42-7A5A. 
Since I'm curious about the history and details of the watch I decided to gather it on this page. 
I will update the page as I gather information, so it's something of a perpetual work-in-progress.

## History
When searching or the watch online, it's usually called Seiko Olympic Chronograph, and with a reference to a year in the early 90s. 
I've seen reference to '91, '92 and '93. I entered the watch model number, as well as serial number, into the [Seiko Date Finder](http://www.watchsleuth.com/seikodatefinder), 
which came back with back unsure. But in standard Seiko fashion the first number in the serial number indicates the year it was made in, and the second number/letter referending the month. 
Since my watch's serial number starts with 1N, it should have been made in 1971, 1981, 1991 or 2001 in November. 
I have seen several people on the internet describing it as the Seiko 1992 Barcelona Olympic Chronograph, so that's my guess. 
And if it was made for a 1992 olympics, it wouldn't be surprising for Seiko to produce it in late 1991.

## Looks
The watch is a black and gold chronograph, and seems seems to have come on either a gold colored bracelet, or on a brown leather strap. Images below.

## Data
* Case diameter: 40mm?
* Case lug-to-lug: 44mm?
* Lug width: 19mm
* Thickness: 8.5mm?
* Battery type: R399

There are several watches with the case code 7t42-7a5a, so the "real name" is one of the following:
* SDX044J1
* SDX044J3 
* SDX048J1 
* SDX048J3 

## Other models
It seems very similar to 5T52-7A29, with the exception of that having a world timer, and obviously another movement.
