## Possible buys

### [Lenovo Yoga C940-14](https://www.prisjakt.nu/jamfor/produkter/5260166,5218665)
Got most stuff. Good hardware (trackpad, keyboard). Around 15k SEK. 2-in-1. Said to have great build-quality. I usually trust Lenovo.

### Dell XPS 13
There are some versions. Seems a few thousands more expensive than XPS 13 though. Around 18k SEK. 2-in-1. Seems to be really good looking but crap keyboard.

### HP Spectre x360 13
Many seem to prefer this over the Lenovo. Seems like the hardware is basically as good. This one should have a bit more battery life in general. Around 17k SEK. Some say these have bad build quality. OLED-screen (unsure if this is great, or too battery consuming though)
