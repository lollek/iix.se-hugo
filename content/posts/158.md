I created this page when trying to identify a watch I was given by my father-in-law. After finding multiple pages refering to it as the 441267, I will treat it as solved.

## Text on dial
Wostok - 18 jewels - Made in USSR

**Note**: Since it's named Wostok instead of 'Boctok', it's made for export and not the internal market. Fully russian versions of the same model also exist. 
Some quick googling told me that Wostoks changed the export name to Vostok in the 90s.

## Data

Measurements are done by me, and might not be the official numbers.

* Model: 441267
* Width: 33mm
* Length: 41mm
* Lug-to-lug: 18mm
* Crystal: Acrylic
* Case material: Chrome plated on brass
* Movement: [Calibre 2214](http://www.ranfft.de/cgi-bin/bidfun-db.cgi?10&ranfft&&2uswk&Wostok_2214)
* Year manifactured: 1970s
* Notes
    - From Chistopol Watch Factory

## Movement
The movement seems to be Wostok Calibre 2214, which is the date, non-hacking version of 2209. There is also the 2234 which has date with hacking. The power reserve should therefore be 38 hours, and the frequency should be 18000 vibrations per hour.
