Some notes on a watch I have been given, which I'm trying to identify.

Text on dial: Wostok - 18 jewels - Made in USSR

## Data

Measurements are done by me, and might not be the official numbers.

* Model: 441267 (According to [here](https://mroatman.wixsite.com/watches-of-the-ussr/vostok))
* Width: 33mm
* Length: 41mm
* Lug-to-lug: 18mm
* Crystal: Acrylic
* Case material: Likely stainless steel. Might be plated. 
* Movement: Calibre 2214
* Year manifactured: 1970s
* Notes: Chistopol Watch Factory

## Movement
The movement seems to be Wostok Calibre 2214, which is the date, non-hacking version of 2209. There is also the 2234 which has date with hacking. The power reserve should therefore be 38 hours, and the frequency should be 18000 vibrations per hour.
