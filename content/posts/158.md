Some notes on a watch I have been given, which I'm trying to identify.

Text on dial: Wostok - 18 jewels - Made in USSR

## Data

* Width: 33mm
* Length: 41mm
* Lug-to-lug: 18mm
* Crystal: Acrylic?
* Year manifactured: 1970-1989?

## Movement
The movement seems to be Wostok Calibre 2214, which is the date, non-hacking version of 2209. There is also the 2234 which has date with hacking. The power reserve should therefore be 38 hours, and the frequency should be 18000 vibrations per hour.
