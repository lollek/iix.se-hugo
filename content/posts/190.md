## About

A quick and dirty sokoban game with 50 levels. Made just when I started
university.

Graphics by Sofie Aid.

Source code can be found here:
* [Javascript](https://github.com/lollek/sokoban.js)

## How to play

Move with WASD or HJKL. Reset the game with space.

The goal is to move all boxes into the marked zone.
