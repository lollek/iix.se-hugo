## Preamble
My main computer is a Lenovo C940 laptop, which has a few orientations it supports.
You can either have it in its clamshell shape i.e. like you normally use a laptop.
Then you can fold the keyboard backwards until it hits the backside of the monitor, effectively turning it into a tablet.
And then you can place it like a tent, basically upside down. 
I usually use all of these depending on what I do. Clamshell when reading and typing. 
Tented with an external keyboard when writing a lot. And tablet mode when only reading.
Maybe surprisingly, the Linux support has been great. 
The only thing missing is usually that the board does not turn off automatically, but the automatic screen rotation has been perfect.

I recently changed Linux distro to Fedora and noticed that my display no longer rotates with the laptop.
I currently use Gnome (which I have tried before and it usually works) with Wayland (which I haven't tried with this laptop before). 
I know that it works with X11, but I don't want to use X11 because it's time to let that old dinosaur die.
So I will write down troubleshooting notes here until I find a solution
