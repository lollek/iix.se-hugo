## Ingredients

* 3 packages halloumi
* 1 tablespoon tomato puree
* 2.5 dl whipping cream
* 1 teaspoon paprika powder
* black pepper
* 1 pinch of cayenne pepper
* 1 "pot" of basil
* (Optionally 1 yellow onion)

## Yellow Onion?
I like adding a yellow onion, but it makes the dish noticably sweeter. Likely, it would make a normal sausage stroganoff too sweet, but suit the more salty halloumi stroganoff well.

If you want yellow onion I'd recommend you dice it and fry it the first thing until golden brown. A tip is adding salt as you start frying, as it makes the liquid disappear faster and make the onion caramellize faster, which in turn makes for a sweeter taste. When the onion is done, you take it up from the pot while frying the halloumi. When the halloumi is done, you add the onion again.

## Prep

* Start your rice cooker
* Cut the halloumi into rectangles

## Steps
* Fry halloumi in oil until golden brown. It's better to overdo it than to underdo it, since it needs the texture.
* Add tomato puree and stir for a few minutes
* Add whipping cream, paprika powder, pepper and cayenne.
* Let it boil for a few of minutes.
* Optionally add some milk or water if you find it too thick.
* Remove the leaves from the basil, roll them and cut into the pot with some scissors
