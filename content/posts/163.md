Some notes on a watch which I'm renovating

Text on dial: Ruhla - Antimagnetic - Made in GDR

Text on case back: Electronically timed - Stainless steel back

## Data

Measurements are done by me, and might not be the official numbers.

* Width: ?
* Length: ?
* Height: ?
* Lug-to-lug: ?
* Movement: Unknown movement, most likely Eppler
  - Pin pallet escapement
* Case: Stainless steel
* Crystal: Acrylic

## Initial Problems

* Crystal is cracked
* Only runs when shaking

## Troubleshooting

* Opened up and cleaned all parts.
* Wound and let run for 24 hours. It's hard to time because the power reserve seems to be less than 24 hours.
* Crown is damaged and needs replacing
