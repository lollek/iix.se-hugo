| 14-15 weeks      | Biking 8km daily and can walk short distances at a brisk pace without any strain. Walking up stairs is easy, walking down stairs is a bit unnatural due to lack of flexibility. Foot is stiff when I haven't stretched for a while, and very stiff in the morning. Rarely lightly swollen ankle. |
| 15-16 weeks      | Can walk a few kilometers, but not really pick up the pace for long. Walking down some stairs is a bit problematic. Foot is stiff in the mornings. I no longer get swollen. |

| 18-19 weeks      | Same as previous week, but foot is barely ever swollen |
| 19-20 weeks      | Can walk almost 3km without pain. Can use the crosstrainer for almost 30 minutes before I get lopsided. I now only stretch once a day, in the morning, to loosen up the foot. |
| 20-21 weeks      | No real improvement. Stopped stretching. |
| 21-22 weeks      | Can walk 5km at a brisk pace. Can do around 10 single leg calf raises at half height. |

| 27-28 weeks      | Swollen foot. Can only go for short walks. No jogging. |
| 28-29 weeks      | Constantly lightly swollen and aching foot. Can only walk for around 30 minutes or the swelling increases. Started stretching again. |
| 29-30 weeks      | Slightly stiff ankle, especially in the morning. Constantly sore calf muscles. Can easily walk 5km+ again. |
| 30-31 weeks      | No obvious improvement. |
| 31-32 weeks      | Changed physiotherapist, since I was very unsatisfied with my previous one, and got a much better training programme. Can now walk/run for 2.5km within 25 minutes two/three times a week. |
| 32-33 weeks      | Can walk/run for 2.5km within 19 minutes every other day. |
