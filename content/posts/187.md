Easy peasy recipe

## Ingredients
* 500 g Chicken fillet
* A clove of garlic
* 1.5 dl Sweet Chilli sauce
* 4-5 dl Whipping cream
* ~2 teaspoons Curry powder
* 2 tablespoons Mango chutney
* ~2 teaspoons Sambal oelek
* A touch of Cayenne powder
* Optional: Some bacon

## Steps
1. Put the oven on 225Â°C
2. Put the whipping cream in a bowl and whip it until it's a bit fluffy. Don't overwork it, it should still be liquid.
3. Pour in the sweet chilli sauce, curry powder, mango chutney, sambal oelek and cayenne pepper and mix it. Taste and add more stuff if you want.
4. Do you have bacon?
     * Yes) Fry it in a dry pan, add some garlic at the end. Put it on a paper towel
     * No) Fry the garlic in some oil. Keep the garlic in the pan.
5. Put the chicken in the pan and start frying it. Season with salt, pepper, curry powder, and maybe some cayenne powder.
6. Put the chicken in an oven form. Pour over the whipping cream mix and put it in the oven for 15 minutes.
7. Serve with rice. Works well with peanuts or desiccated coconut as topping.
