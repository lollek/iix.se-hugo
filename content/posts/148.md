## What I expected

When running Krita in Windows on a Lenovo C940 laptop I should be able to use the built-in pen to get pressure sensitivity.
E.g. when using a pen which becomes larger the more you press.

## What I got

The pressure sensitivity is non-functional but strange.
On a normal document, when doing quick swipes with a pressure sensitive pen, there is a thin line and many large circles which appear haphazardly.
Selecting just a single point of the screen and pressing seems to maybe work. But when the pen is moved, the large cicles appear immediately.
Also, when in the scratchpad, everything works perfectly.

## How I solved it

* In Windows, go to Settings > Pen & Windows Ink
* Activate "Let me use my pen as a mouse in some desktop apps"

Then it immediately works as expected.
