A quick-and-dirty webified game.

During the christmas of 2014 I was over at my in-laws' place. There I found this
game, where you have 9 tiles, organized in a 3x3 grid, and the goal was to
swap or rotate the witches so that all witches have the correct color and
orientation. At first I thought it would be really easy, but I never managed to
solve it on my own, instead I wrote a small program brute-forcing the solution.

To see what the original game looks like, google for "Crazy Witch Game"

As written on the box, there are two solutions (which can be rotated in 4
directions, effectively making it 8 solutions). Since I found the game
fascinating, I have created it in javascript-form here for you to play. Instead
of witches, you will have to make do with chameleons (created in paint by my wife).
I can recommend creating your own solver for it, it's pretty fun, and shouldn't
be too hard.

You play by selecting two cards, which will swap their places. Clicking on a
card twice will rotate it 90 degrees.
