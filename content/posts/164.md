Some notes on a watch which I'm renovating

## Data

* Width: ?
* Length: ?
* Height: ?
* Lug-to-lug: ?

  - Pin lever escapement
* Case: Seems to be gold plated.

## Problems

- [x] Doesn't run despite being fully wound
- [ ] One jewel for the balance wheel is missing
- [ ] Mainspring is broken.

## Troubleshooting steps

* Opened up and cleaned all parts.
* One jewel for the balance wheel is missing
* The arbor was stuck to one or both bridges. After thorough cleaning the watch began running. However the mainspring catch immediately broke, making it impossible to wind.
