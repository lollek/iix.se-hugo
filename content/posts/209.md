**Easy Pace**  
You should feel like you could easily hold a conversation with someone at this pace.

**Interval Pace**  
Interval Pace - This is the pace you will be running most of your
speed sessions at. It's important to note that this isn't an all out
sprint, far from it! Ideally your interval pace will be roughly what you
could hold for an all out 5k.

**Strides**  
These are 20 second bursts of fast running, around 95%
effort with a 45-60 second rest between each.
