## Crontab for renewal

    # m h  dom mon dow   command
    15  3   *   *   *    certbot renew --quiet --no-self-upgrade --pre-hook "systemctl stop nginx.service" --post-hook "systemctl start nginx.service"

## Docker alternative
Note that if you run certbot in docker, you cannot use the --pre-hook and --post-hook as the other services cannot be changed through the docker container. Instead, you should create a script file, where you run the --pre-hook before the command and --post-hook afterwards

    systemctl stop nginx.service

    docker run --rm --name certbot -v "/etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt:Z" \
        -v "/var/lib/letsencrypt:/var/lib/letsencrypt:Z" \
        -p80:80 \
        -p443:443 \
        certbot/certbot renew \
        --quiet \
        --no-self-upgrade 

    systemctl start nginx.service
