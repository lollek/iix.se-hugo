Regarding John Updike's Toward the End of Time

> Maybe the one thing that the reader ends up appreciating about Ben Turnbull is that he’s such a broad caricature of an 
> Updike protagonist that he helps clarify what’s been so unpleasant and frustrating about this author’s recent characters. 
> It’s not that Turnbull is stupid: he can quote Pascal and Kierkegaard on angst, discourse on the death of Schubert, 
> distinguish between a sinistrorse and a dextrorse Polygonum vine, etc. 
> It’s that he persists in the bizarre, adolescent belief that getting to have sex with whomever one wants whenever one wants to is a cure for human despair. 
> And Toward the End of Time’s author, so far as I can figure out, believes it too. 
> Updike makes it plain that he views the narrator’s final impotence as catastrophic, as the ultimate symbol of death itself, 
> and he clearly wants us to mourn it as much as Turnbull does. 
> I am not shocked or offended by this attitude; I mostly just don’t get it. 
> Rampant or flaccid, Ben Turnbull’s unhappiness is obvious right from the novel’s first page. 
> It never once occurs to him, though, that the reason he’s so unhappy is that he’s an asshole.

**David Foster Wallace, “Certainly the end of something or other, one would sort of have to think”.**
