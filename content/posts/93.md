When I get some spare time I would like to make rsyslogd write its contents to database, and parse it through a web interface. In the meantime I'll just collect some guides here.

* [Writing syslog messages to MySQL, PostgreSQL or any other supported Database](http://www.rsyslog.com/doc/v8-stable/tutorials/database.html)  
* [Handling a massive syslog database insert rate with Rsyslog](http://www.rsyslog.com/doc/v8-stable/tutorials/high_database_rate.html)  
* [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch)  
* [Elasticsearch - Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash)  
* [Elasticsearch - Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana)
