Some notes on a watch which I'm renovating

Text on dial: Eklora - Incabloc - Swiss Made

Text on case back: Swiss Made - Waterprotected - Incabloc - Stainless Steel Back

## Data

Measurements are done by me, and might not be the official numbers.

* Width: ?
* Length: ?
* Height: ?
* Lug-to-lug: ?
* Movement: [FHF 974](http://www.ranfft.de/cgi-bin/bidfun-db.cgi?10&ranfft&0&2uswk&FHF_974)
  - Date complication
* Case: Stainless steel
* Crystal: Acrylic

## Problemss

- [ ] Crystal has cracked
- [ ] Only runs when winding, stops shortly afterward, even when fully wound
- [ ] Rusty date wheel

## Troubleshooting

* Rust
  - Opened up and cleaned all parts. Some screws have rusted off, but all parts seem to work
  - I lost the date spring somewhere
  - Rust is limited to the date complication. Other areas untouched.
* Only runs when winding
  - During deconstruction, the mainspring was stuck to the barrel bridge. Barrel arbor very rusty. Cleaned and oiled, but is still not working as it should.
  - After reconstruction, the mainspring gets charged, but will not apply the power to the train of wheels. It's possible to unwind the mainspring. Possibly problem with the pivot on the other side of the mainspring getting stuck?
