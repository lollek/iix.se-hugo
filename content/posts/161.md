Some notes on a watch which I'm renovating

Text on dial: Eklora - Incabloc - Swiss Made

Text on case back: Swiss Made - Waterprotected - Incabloc - Stainless Steel Back

## Data

Measurements are done by me, and might not be the official numbers.

* Width: ?
* Length: ?
* Height: ?
* Lug-to-lug: ?
* Movement: [FHF 974](http://www.ranfft.de/cgi-bin/bidfun-db.cgi?10&ranfft&0&2uswk&FHF_974)
  - Date complication
* Case: Stainless steel
* Crystal: Acrylic

## Initial Problems

* Crystal has cracked
* Only runs when winding, stops shortly afterward, even when fully wound
* Rusty date wheel

## Troubleshooting

* Rust
  - Opened up and cleaned all parts. Some screws have rusted off, but all parts seem to work
  - I lost the date spring somewhere
  - Rust is limited to the date complication. Other areas untouched.
* Only runs when winding
  - During deconstruction, the mainspring was stuck to the barrel bridge. Barrel arbor very rusty. Cleaned and oiled, but is still not working as it should.
