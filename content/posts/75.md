I've been looking to buy some kind of external storage for a while now, and this page is pretty much my scratch-page for collecting data.

Requirements:
1. Hardware (requirements)
  1. Space for 4-6 3.5" HDDs
  1. Quiet enough to be unnoticeable from a few meters away
  1. Should be around the same size as the hard drives put together (with some space in between of course)
  1. Gigabit ethernet
1. Hardware (nice to have)
  1. Possibility of mounting 2.5" disks
  1. Fans should be still when the drive is not in use
  1. Some high-speed connection, like eSATA or USB3, which can be connected directly to another computer
1. Software (requirements), *if I can simply install linux on the machine, then the features below are not required*
  1. RAID 10
  1. Samba
  1. Logging/status (CPU, Memory, Storage, Temperature)
  1. Access restriction on a user level + anonymous access
1. Software (nice to have)
  1. RAID 6
  1. Wake-on-Lan
