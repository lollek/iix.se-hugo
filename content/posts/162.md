Some notes on a watch which I'm renovating

Text on dial: Audix - Antimagnetic

Text on case back: Automatic - Waterproof - Non Magnetic - Shock Protected - 704144

## Data

Measurements are done by me, and might not be the official numbers.

* Width: ?
* Length: ?
* Height: ?
* Lug-to-lug: ?
* Movement: Unknown movement, most likely Eppler
  - Date complication
  - Pin pallet escapement
* Case: Stainless steel
* Crystal: Acrylic

## Problems

- [ ] Crystal has deep scratches
- [x] Only runs when shaking

## Troubleshooting

* Opened up and cleaned all parts.
* Wound and let run for 24 hours. It times around +200s/d, but seems to have a healthy power reserve.
* It seems that the watch does not have a seconds hand, and there is no wheel that drives the seconds hand. Unsure if this is by design or the wheel is simply missing.
