[Thomas Aquinas'] teachings
constitute a complete system, which is why, as ‘Thomism’, they provide the
Roman Catholic Church with its philosophy, whose official status was
further confirmed by Pope Pius X in Doctoris Angelici (June 1914): ‘The
capital theses in the philosophy of St Thomas are not to be placed in the
category of opinions capable of being debated one way or another, but are
to be considered as the foundations upon which the whole science of natural
and divine things is based; if such principles are once removed or in any
way impaired, it must necessarily follow that students of the sacred sciences
will ultimately fail to perceive so much as the meaning of the words in
which the dogmas of divine revelation are proposed by the magistracy of
the Church.’ This places Thomistic philosophy and theology above all
debate, which – at least in the case of philosophy – is precisely contrary to
what philosophy should be.
