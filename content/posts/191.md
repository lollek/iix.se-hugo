## About

This is a game I made during my first year in university, since we had a class where
we were supposed to make a C++ game. At first I intended to make a Robo
Rally-style game, but my course partner dropped out, so I made this instead
since it was quicker.

Graphics by Sofie Aid.

## How to play

Use arrow keys left and right to control the astronaut. 

The goal is to get as many points as possible
