This is a very broad title, and will probably not help anyone except for me if this happens for me again.  

One day when I had to restart my KVM host, none of my guests had internet connection. The eth0 on the KVM host was attached to a bridge (br0) and that host had connectivity through the bridge. Here are some configs (which had not changed since it worked):
```
# /etc/network/interfaces

source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface
allow-hotplug eth0
iface eth0 inet manual
#iface eth0 inet dhcp


auto br0
iface br0 inet dhcp
	bridge_ports eth0
	bridge_stp off
	bridge_fd 0
	bridge_maxwait 0
```
Configuration seems good to me.
I have never needed stp=on, so it should be alright.  

```
$ ip a
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo

    link/ether (...)
    inet6 fe80::fc54:ff:feed:6dc4/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```
Everything seems in order. We have an ip address on br0 and everything seems attached to the bridge.  

```
$ sudo brctl show
bridge name	bridge id		STP enabled	interfaces
br0		8000.b8aeedea92ce	no		eth0
							vnet0
							vnet1
							vnet2
							vnet3
```
Some duplicate info here, but just to make sure the bridge is set up correctly.  

Then i saw that iptables had the following policy:
```
Chain FORWARD (policy DROP 8254 packets, 2386K bytes)
```

Change chain policy to make sure forwards are sent properly.  
```
sudo iptables --policy FORWARD ACCEPT
```

I am unsure why it happened in the first place. Maybe related to docker in some way? Since much of my iptables configuration is created by services I am unsure how to persist this in a good way. So I probably will need to fix this next time I reboot (which will likely be in several years), and by then I will have forgotten about it. Hence this post.

UPDATE:
Apparently it is a race condition between kvm and docker. Depending on who starts first. I only have to apply this about 50% of the time.
