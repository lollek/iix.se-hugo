If you are using firefox on linux with a dark theme, unstyled input fields will have black background and white text. Sometimes just white text on white background.

According to [this bug report](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1283086) it has been this way for the last 17 years. To fix it, pop into about:config and add a new key-value (String): "widget.content.gtk-theme-override": "Adwaita:light". After restarting firefox, things will be as they should be.
