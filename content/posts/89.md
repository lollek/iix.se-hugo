Extending the certificate to also cover www.iix.se  

```bash
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d iix.se,www.iix.se,monit.iix.se,test.iix.se                                                                                          Sat Nov 04 11:14 W44

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You have an existing certificate that contains a portion of the domains you
requested (ref: /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/iix.se.conf)

It contains these names: iix.se, monit.iix.se, test.iix.se

You requested these names for the new certificate: iix.se, www.iix.se,
monit.iix.se, test.iix.se.

Do you want to expand and replace this existing certificate with the new
certificate?

IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/iix.se/fullchain.pem. Your cert will expire
   on 2018-02-02. To obtain a new or tweaked version of this
   certificate in the future, simply run certbot again. To
   non-interactively renew *all* of your certificates, run "certbot
   renew"
